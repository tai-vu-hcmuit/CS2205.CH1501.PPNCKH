Image Super-Resolution by Neural Texture Transfer : Due to the significant information loss in low-resolution (LR) images, it has become extremely challenging to further advance the state-of-the-art of single image super-resolution (SISR). Reference-based super-resolution (RefSR), on the other hand, has proven to be promising in recovering high-resolution (HR) details when a reference (Ref) image with similar content as that of the LR input is given. However, the quality of RefSR can degrade severely when Ref is less similar


## 4. Các bài toán cần phải nghiên cứu  : 
- Formulate the RefSR problem as Neural texture transfer
- Design an end-to-end deep model which enriches HR details by adaptively transferring the texture from Ref images according to their textural similarity
- Our key contribution is a multi-level matching conducted in the neural space.
- Build a benchmark dataset for the general research of RefSR, which contains Ref images paired with LR inputs with varying levels of similarity
